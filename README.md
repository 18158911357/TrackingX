# TrackingX

TrackingX is an Object Oriented MATLAB toolkit for Multi-Target Tracking, aimed at providing a common framework for swift prototyping and evaluation of multi-target tracking algorithms.  

The class architecture and interfaces of TrackingX are being designed such that algorithms of the same class (e.g. Dynamic Models) provide a common interface to all classes that utilise them (e.g. Filters), thus allowing for a virtual plug&play relation between various classes of algorithms.

NOTE: Development is still in progress
